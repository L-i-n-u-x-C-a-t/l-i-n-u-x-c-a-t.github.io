    <div class="category"><h3>3DS Important information Booklets</h3></div>
    <div class="entry">· 6206132L3<br>Nintendo 3DS &amp; 3DS XL 
important information booklet, Europe, version 1.3. Labeled 6206132L3   
0513/NK  EUA on the front cover and [0413/EUA] on the back.</div>
    <div class="entry">· 6206132L6<br>Nintendo 3DS important information
 booklet, Europe, version 1.6. Labeled 6206132L6   0514/NK  EUA on the 
front cover and [0514/EUA] on the back. the only noticeable change is <a href="L3-L6.jpg">the 3DS XL logo being removed</a>.</div>
    <div class="entry">· 6206132L7<br>Nintendo 3DS important information
 booklet, Europe, version 1.7. Labeled 6206132L7   0814/NK  EUA on the 
front cover (or just EUA sometimes) and [0714/EUA] on the back. A change
 only appears in the EUA-labeled one, as anything else was removed.</div>
    <div class="entry">· 6206132L8<br>Nintendo 3DS important information
 booklet, Europe, version 1.8. Labeled EUA on the front cover and 
[0715/EUA] on the back. What changed this time is the font on the back 
cover.</div>
    <div class="entry">· 6206132L8 "1214"<br>Nintendo 3DS important 
information booklet, Europe, version 1.8. Labeled EUA on the front cover
 and [1214/EUA] on the back. This one has a different number on the back
 cover, and after looking quickly the only change is the Nintendo 
Service in germany being at another place and having another name 
(Nintendo of Europe GmbH).</div>
    <div class="entry">· 6206132L9<br>Nintendo 3DS important information
 booklet, Europe, version 1.9. Labeled EUA on the front cover and 
[1115/EUA] on the back. I didnt notice anything different from the L8, 
but it still has the "Nintendo Service", so maybe this was made before 
the L8 "1214".</div>
    <div class="entry">· 6215932L<br>Nintendo 3DS important information 
booklet, Europe, version 2. Labeled EUA on the front cover and 
[0817/EUA] on the back. as this has the "Nintendo Service" thing, it may
 also have been made before the L8 "1214", but since it starts by 621 
instead of 620, i've labeled it as version 2.</div>
    <div class="entry">· 6215932L1<br>Nintendo 3DS important information
 booklet, Europe, version 2.1. Labeled EUA on the front cover and 
[0218/EUA] on the back. Now this one is weird. While being 1 number 
above the previous booklet, it is also way behind if we look at the back
 cover number. plus, it only has 1 address, which is Nintendo of Europe 
GmbH, in germany, but not in the same place as the L8 "1214".</div>
    <div class="entry">· 6206199L6<br>Nintendo 3DS important information
 booklet, Spain+Italia+Portugal, version 1.6. Labeled EIP (for Espana 
Italia Portugal) on the front cover and [0715/EIP] on the back. You 
probably guessed, this booklet is only in 3 languages. This seems weird 
that Nintendo did not include those languages in their main booklets. I 
don't even know why i have one.</div>

    <div class="category"><h3>DS Health and Safety Precautions Booklets</h3></div>
    <div class="entry">· 5807466 "209"<br>Nintendo DS Health and Safety Precautions booklet, Europe. Labeled NDL-EUR 5807466 0209/NK on the front. </div>
    <div class="entry">· 5807466 "911"<br>Nintendo DS Health and Safety 
Precautions booklet, Europe. Labeled NDL-EUR 5807466 0911/NK on the 
front. The difference between this one and the 209 is the font change 
insid of the booklet. Otherwise they seem to be identical.</div>
    <br>
    <div class="category"><h3>Nintendo Eshop Booklets</h3></div>
    <div class="entry">· 6214131L<br>Nintendo Eshop booklet, Version 1, Europe. This is just promoting some games on the Nintendo Eshop.</div>
    <div class="entry">· 6214131L1<br>Nintendo Eshop booklet, Version 
1.1, Europe. This one is similar to the previous one, the only changes 
are Yo-kai watch being replaced by Yo-kai watch 2 (the 2 versions) and 
Fairune being replaced by Fairune 2.</div>
    <div class="entry">· 6214131L2<br>Nintendo Eshop booklet, Version 
1.2, Europe. Again, This one is similar to the previous one, the only 
changes are Potzol's puzzle being replaced by kirby's blowout blast and 
HarmoKnight being replaced by Team Kirby Clash Deluxe.</div>
    <div class="entry">· 10000306<br>Nintendo Eshop booklet, Version 2, 
Europe. This one is similar to the previous ones, but many game changed.
 Monster Hunter Generations was replaced by Monster Hunter Stories, 
Yo-kai watch 2 was relaced by miitopia, Team Kirby Clash Deluxe was 
relaced by Bloodstained Curse of the Moo, and Nintendo Badge Arcade was 
replaced by Phoenix Wright Ace Attorney Trilogy. On top of that, the 
screenshots and images promoting My Nintendo changed too.</div>
    <br>
    <div class="category"><h3>Nintendo 3DS/DS Family booklets</h3></div>
    <div class="entry">· 6208066M1<br>Nintendo 3DS Family Booklet, 
Version 1.1, Europe. This booklet is showing some 3DS games, and if you 
look at the back cover you'll have some "Software instructions" pages.</div>
    <div class="entry">· 6208066M2<br>Nintendo 3DS Family Booklet, 
Version 1.2, Europe. The main difference is the displayed games are not 
the same. Plus, the "Nintendo 3DS Family" text disappeared from the 
front cover.</div>
    <div class="entry">· 6208066M3<br>Nintendo 3DS Family Booklet, 
Version 1.3, Europe. Again, some games inside change. Another difference
 is the screenshot for the software instructions are not the same, so 
the 3DS firmware probably got updated in-between.</div>
    <div class="entry">· 6208066M6<br>Nintendo 3DS Family Booklet, 
Version 1.6, Europe. Here, the front cover is not the same, instead of 
having the 2DS, the 3DS and the 3DS XL, there is the 2DS, the new 3DS 
(with changeable cover plates) and the new 3DS XL. Plus, instead of 
having a big red "www.nintendo-europe.com" button, there is a QR code. 
Also, it is now written "Viewing Software Electronics Manual" on the 
back cover. And, again, the games are not the same.</div>
    <div class="entry">· 6208066M7<br>Nintendo 3DS Family Booklet, 
Version 1.7, Europe. Here, it is noted at the bottom of the front cover 
that the 3DS systems can display games in 2D as well. And yet again game
 changes.</div>
    <div class="entry">· 6213966M<br>Nintendo 3DS Family Booklet, 
Version 2, Europe. I don't see why the number changes, since the games 
shown are the same as the ones in 1.7. The only change i've noticed is 
on the back cover, the text changes once again and is now "Viewing 
Software Manuals".</div>
    <div class="entry">· 6213966M1<br>Nintendo 3DS Family Booklet, Version 2.1, Europe. Guess what changed? The games! yeah thats all.</div>
    <div class="entry">· 6213966M3<br>Nintendo 3DS Family Booklet, 
Version 2.3, Europe. Here, the main change is the new 3DS being replaced
 withe the new 2DS XL. also other games changes.</div>
    <div class="entry">· 6203066M5<br>Nintendo 3DS/3DS XL Booklet, 
Version ?, Europe. This one looks like the other ones, except it does 
not have a "Software instructions" page, its back cover is just credits 
and the big nintendo-europe button. Its front cover also has the button 
and just presents the 3DS XL.</div>
    <div class="entry">· 5815466M1<br>Nintendo 3DS Booklet, Version ?.1 
(not the same as the previous one), Europe. This one looks a bit like 
the previous one, except it promotes the 3DS showing that it can play DS
 and 3DS games. The games shown in it are from both consoles, and there 
is no Software instructions.</div>
    <div class="entry">· 5811066<br>Nintendo DS(i) Family Booklet, 
Version ?, Europe. This booklet presents DS games, but has the DSi on 
the front cover. it even has 2 pages of wii games at the end.</div>
